# Algorithm-Showcase
A showcase of algorithms using C++
1) Luhn's Algotithm
2) Sorting Algorithms 


## Libraries used
[Matplot++](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/),
[imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui),
[OpenGL](https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html), and
[GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)

## Sorting Algorithms
 All sorting algorithms can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)


You will need to install 
[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started),
[Matplot++](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/integration/package-managers/vcpkg/), and
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html)
### Installation for gnuplot
Windows
 └─ during  installation you need to check "add to env variables"
    
    	If it is not checked, you will need to pass the .exe location when it is instantiated

### TODO
 Fix some sorting algorithms
 
 When visualizing the sorting algorithms, hightlight the numbers that it is currently on and 
 the number that it is being compared to.

 Sort with the same graph and not create a new one.
